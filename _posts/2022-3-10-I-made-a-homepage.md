title: I made a homepage
---

This is a simple site.

At this moment, it just includes
[this blog](/blog)
and some information about me
(like
[my CV](/cv-jgl.pdf),
[my scientific publications](/scholar), or
[my code](https://github.com/yiyus)).

The site is hosted on
[github](https://github.com/yiyus/yiyus.github.io)
and based on
[jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
I modified the templates and the CSS a little bit,
and also added
[Google Scholar for Github pages](https://cmccomb.com/google-scholar-for-github-pages/)
to display the 
[publications list](/scholar).
